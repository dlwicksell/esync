This is a daemon program that uses the inotify kernel calls to keep
directories of files synced between a primary and secondary host.

It was written as part of the infrastructure for a VistA system. Though
this daemon is generic enough to keep any files synced between two hosts,
the configure script, and the init script are written specifically to keep
M[UMPS] routines using GT.M synced between a primary and a secondary
replication instance of GT.M. That way, the routines that act on the data in
a GT.M system are always kept the same on the secondary database instance as
they are on the primary.

To install this, you untar the tarball, as you've already done..
    $ tar xfz esync-0.1.tgz

Then you move to the resulting esync/ directory..
    $ cd esync/

Then you run make to compile the daemon..
    $ make

Then you run make install as root to install the daemon.. 
    $ sudo make install

Then you run the esync-install script as root to install the init
script, add it to the appropriate system runlevels, install the man page
for the daemon, and startup the various esyncd daemons..
    $ sudo ./install

That is pretty much all there is to it. If you have questions on how
to use the esyncd daemon, consult the man page..
    $ man esyncd

To uninstall the esync package..
    $ sudo ./uninstall

If you need to clean up the object files, and the ELF executable, locally..
    $ make clean
